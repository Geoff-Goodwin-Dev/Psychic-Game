# Hangman Game

* **Created:** Saturday, February 24th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the third week's 1st homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are constructing a Psychic (letter-guessing) Game using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this assignment, you'll create one of two possible computer games: Hangman or Psychic. These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
